# Bank-Churn-Prediction
Bank Churn Prediction
Bank churn is a significant challenge for financial institutions where customers end their banking 
relationships. Understanding and predicting customer churn is crucial for banks to retain customers, 
enhance satisfaction, and boost profitability. This project aims to tackle the issue of bank churn 
using binary classification techniques. 

In this analysis, we will examine a dataset containing various customer attributes such as 
demographic information, account details, and transaction history. Our primary objective is to 
develop a predictive model that accurately identifies customers who are likely to churn. By 
utilizing data science and machine learning techniques, we aim to uncover the factors contributing 
to customer churn. 

We will start with a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution 
and relationships of different variables. Following this, we will preprocess the data, build, and 
evaluate several machine learning models, and select the best-performing model for predicting 
customer churn.
